            <h1 class="Heading-2">Temple of The Tooth Relic</h1>
            <p class="Main-text-2">A visit to the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a must when you are in Kandy. The most revered site in Sri Lanka, it is locally known as the Sri Dalada Maligawa and is a place of worship established in the 16th century AD. Situated adjacent to the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, the shrine overlooks the vast expanse of the Kandy Lake.
               Preserving the Relic of Buddha in this haven of refuge, it was declared that whoever houses and protects it is automatically given the power to rule the country. The artefact serves as a significant symbol of Sinhalese identity and pride. Everyday thousands of white-clad pilgrims make their way to this hallowed space, bearing lotus blossoms and frangipani for their offerings and prayers, known as pujas. While the tooth stays hidden within a gold casket, visitors and devotees always visit the Temple during puja just to have a look at the well protected inner shrine where it is kept.
               Annually, during the Esala Perahera procession, the Relic casket gets paraded through the streets atop a male elephant. The 10-day festival is one of the largest Buddhist festivals in the world and the most significant in Sri Lanka.

            <h1 class="Heading-2">Arts and Crafts</h1>
            <p class="Main-text-2">Kandy is synonymous with arts and crafts of Sri Lanka than anywhere else in the country. It is probably because the Kandy is where all elite who patronised these crafts survived during 300 years of war with the Europeans. Kandy is probably the best place to buy most of the handicrafts produced in Sri Lanka because there are number of shops catering to the tourists. Tourists could watch local crafts coming into life at the At the Kandyan Art Association.
               At Kundasale, about 4km from Kandy, a village has been established recently to settle local craftsmen and their families.

            <h1 class="Heading-2">Malwatte and Asgiriya Monasteries</h1>
            <p class="Main-text-2">Kandy’s principal Buddhist Viharas (Monasteries) have considerable importance – the chief incumbents (high priests) of these two monasteries, are the senior ecclesiastics of the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka.  The Malwatte monastery on the southern side across the lake is embellished with 18th century architectural design and planning. The higher order ordination of the sangha (the monks), take place annually in both these temples.
               The Asgiriya Temple is situated in the western side of the city at Asgiriya. In one of the shrine rooms of this temple is a gigantic Buddha statue of the recumbent Buddha. In Asgiriya is also found the cremation ground of the Kandyan Royalty.
